## Learning materials

### [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book)

This book is general a good starting point for beginners, it covers all the
basics most people want to go through. It's especially handy for people
coming from a scripting language background. And at the end of the book,
there is a little fun app project, too. :)

### [The Rust Cli Book](https://github.com/rust-cli/book)

A great beginner book for learning how to build a CLI tool with `clap`.
